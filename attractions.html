			<h3>The Beachfront</h3>
			<p>Just west of downtown, the sea meets Avelburg in a beatiful beachfront. Travel on the postcard-worthy boardwalk trams, ride the ferris wheel, enjoy a bite to eat at a pier cafe, or walk along the beach. A favorite for history buffs is the World War 2 memorial, complete with an immaculately-kept original beach combat trench. The hotels and shopping centers are plentiful here, so you could easily spend a weekend on the beach.</p>
